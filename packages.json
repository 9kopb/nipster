JSGI is an asynchronous middleware interface based on solid mature middleware design principles, and the asynchronous design fits perfectly with Node. JSGI uses idiomatic JavaScript, leveraging closures for [simple and fast](http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2010/06/11/jsgi-vs-connect-for-node-middleware/) middleware connectivity. There is substantial set of middleware components that can be found on the  [Node modules page](https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/modules#middleware).","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jsgi-node","JSGI middleware server for NodeJS","","1970-1-1",0,3,0,""],["jsgp","Lib for generating random javascript programs.","","1970-1-1",0,2,0,""],["jsgrep","JQuery CSS selectors to grep HTML documents","","1970-1-1",1,7,0,""],["jsgrep-toolkit","Syntactically-aware grep for JavaScript","","1970-1-1",8,87,0,""],["jshamcrest","Library of matcher objects for JavaScript, based on the ideas behind Hamcrest.","","1970-1-1",9,29,0,""],["jshare","Share you server side Node.js/Express variables with your client side Javascript.","","1970-1-1",1,2,0,""],["jshashes","A fast and independent hashing library pure JavaScript implemented for both server and client side","","1970-1-1",3,22,0,""],["jshelpers","Helpers for JavaScript","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jshint","A CLI for JSHint","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jshint-brunch","Adds JSHint support to brunch.","","1970-1-1",3,2,0,""],["jshint-mode","JSHint","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jshint-runner","Command-line runner for JSHint (http://jshint.com)","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jshint-tap","jshint-node compatible reporter to generate tap files (Test Anything Protocol)","","1970-1-1",0,2,0,""],["jshint-tap-simple","tap output for jshint","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jshtml","razor template engine","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jsi","JavaScript Integration System.","","1970-1-1",0,2,0,""],["jsinc","Include non module javascript file as module","","1970-1-1",0,12,0,""],["jsio","js.io module and class system","","1970-1-1",18,274,0,""],["jsiohint","A jsio flavored CLI for JSHint","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["jsk-tabs","Basic behaviours for tab components in a WebPage.","","1970-1-1",0,3,0,""],["jsk-togglable","Basic behaviours for togglable elements in a WebPage.","","1970-1-1",0,3,0,""],["jslardo","a social CMS.

To use it you just need to tell it how dependencies are included in each language you use. Look in the plugins directory for examples. This tool is useful if your language doesn't provide modularisation features natively and you need to bring your own such as in Javascript. Or if you would like to use __multiple languages__ on one project and need a way to integrating them. For example if your doing frontend development, Javascript, coffeescript, Stylus, and Jade might sound like a nice combination of languages to use. Sourcegraph will allow you to pull all your assets together. It outputs an array of file objects. These should then be passed into a compilation tool.   Sourcegraph's job is information gathering. Compilation can be a simple thing if you only use one language, but it can also get messy if you use many. So your compile tool should focus on compilation.   It hasn't yet been implemented but I plan to make sourcegraph a long running process which monitors your project as you write it. This would make it efficient to have a build step while still iterating quickly. Infact I'd expect you could easily outperform run time dependency resolving systems such as node or AMD with long running sourcegraph process combined with a short running compile step. Make your compile step also long running too ... you'll be iterating in as long as it takes to do one disk write and one disk read.","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["splearch","Pattern matching regex abstraction based on Ruby's Dir.glob","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["gr","Gist Runner for Nodejs!","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["yom-angularjs-testing-article","ERROR: No README.md file found!","","1970-1-1",0,0,0,""],["smart-stream","A library and middleware for Node.js Streams.
