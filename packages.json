To use it you just need to tell it how dependencies are included in each language you use. Look in the plugins directory for examples. This tool is useful if your language doesn't provide modularisation features natively and you need to bring your own such as in Javascript. Or if you would like to use __multiple languages__ on one project and need a way to integrating them. For example if your doing frontend development, Javascript, coffeescript, Stylus, and Jade might sound like a nice combination of languages to use. Sourcegraph will allow you to pull all your assets together. It outputs an array of file objects. These should then be passed into a compilation tool.   Sourcegraph's job is information gathering. Compilation can be a simple thing if you only use one language, but it can also get messy if you use many. So your compile tool should focus on compilation.   It hasn't yet been implemented but I plan to make sourcegraph a long running process which monitors your project as you write it. This would make it efficient to have a build step while still iterating quickly. Infact I'd expect you could easily outperform run time dependency resolving systems such as node or AMD with long running sourcegraph process combined with a short running compile step.
