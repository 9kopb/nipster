Perstore\r includes JavaScript object-relational mapping for SQL databases, JSON file storage,\r and hopefully support for many other object/document style storage systems that\r provide more direct object storage. Perstore provides model classes that wrap data\r stores, and supports JSON Schema integrity enforcement, link management, and \r prototype construction. Perstore also provides faceted access to models for an\r object-capability based security model.","Kris Zyp","2012-9-19",1,5,0],["pfadfinder","pfadfinder ==========","Mark Engel","2012-9-20",null,null,0],["pfraze-linkjs","Mediator framework designed for composability in browser applications using the REST style","Paul Frazee","2012-5-30",0,59,0],["pg","PostgreSQL client - pure javascript & libpq with the same API","Brian Carlson","2012-12-16",122,676,7],["pg-hstore","An module for serializing and deserializing JSON data in to hstore format","Seth Carney","2012-12-5",2,4,0],["pgb","PhoneGap Boilerplate","Michal Kuklis","2012-5-31",null,null,0],["phantom","PhantomJS wrapper for Node","Sam Gentle","2012-8-5",72,394,1],["phantom-sync","sync version of phantom","Seb Vincent","2012-10-26",3,16,0],["phaseshift","Phase shift an array","George Stagas","2012-1-24",0,3,0],["phaxio","Send faxes with the Phaxio API","Chad Smith","2012-10-17",5,8,0],["phidgets","a way for nodeJS to talk to a phidget interface kit","Evan Tahler","2012-8-19",2,13,0],["phnq_core","JavaScript core utilities","Patrick Gostovic","2012-11-16",0,1,0],["phnq_ejs","Embedded JavaScript templating tool","Patrick Gostovic","2012-10-31",0,1,0],["phnq_log","JavaScript logging utility","Patrick Gostovic","2012-11-22",0,1,0],["phnq_widgets","Embedded JavaScript templating tool","Patrick Gostovic","2013-1-6",1,2,0],["phoenix","A Package Manager for Phoenix Engine","Lanvige Jiang","2011-12-23",null,null,0],["phonegapbuildapi","A client interface for the Phonegap Build API.","German Escallon","2012-6-27",11,21,0],["phonetap","PhoneTap: a tapped version of PhoneGap, to do tests without running a simulator","elCuervo","2011-9-21",null,null,0],["phony","A fake data generator.","Rod Waldhoff","2012-4-23",0,3,0],["php","Use php-style views in node!","Elmer Bulthuis","2012-4-18",null,null,0],["php-autotest","A utility to watch PHP files and run tests as they change","Chris Khoo","2011-9-19",null,null,0],["phpass","A pure node.js JavaScript port of the portable PHP password hashing framework.","John Hurliman","2012-10-9",null,null,0],["phpbb-password","phpbb's password hashing algorithm for Nodejs","Jean-Sébastien Tremblay","2012-7-19",0,0,0],["phpjs","PHP.js port for Node.js","Alan Hoffmeister","2012-6-1",2,12,0],["physics","JavaScript Physics Engine for node.js and browsers","feisty","2012-4-19",0,2,0],["piano","require-hook for instrumenting your code","Chris Dickinson","2011-8-19",0,7,0],["pibot","personal IRC bot","Pavan Kumar Sunkara","2011-12-22",1,2,0],["pibot--irc",null,null,"2012-4-19",null,null,0],["pibot-basic","basic plugin for personal IRC bot","Pavan Kumar Sunkara","2011-12-24",1,2,0],["pibot-karma","karma plugin for personal IRC bot","Pavan Kumar Sunkara","2011-12-24",1,2,0],["picard","A Micro-framework for node.js","Kellen Presley","2011-5-10",null,null,0],["picardForTynt","A fork of the Picard Micro-framework for node.js","Kellen Presley","2011-4-25",1,2,0],["piccolo","Isomorphic projection framework","Andreas Madsen","2012-8-7",1,9,1],["pick","A simple library for picking random elements of arrays","Andrew Pennebaker","2012-3-10",0,1,0],["pickle","A Python pickled object <-> JSON transport.
